## INTRO


Welcome to my Black Ops GSC Mod Menu

This works on XBOX360, PS3 and PC and thanks to @ImJtagModz you are able to connect to other players!

This menu / mod aims for a non-gamebreaking experience in regular mp to allow trickshotters and feeders to have a easier and fun time.



## INSTALLATION


You need the InfinityOps files from @ImJtagModz on Twitter

(From **@ImJtagModz** post)

To load scripts or menus you place the .gsc files in the respective places i.e maps/mp/gametypes/clientids.gsc

The PS3 Edition includes eboots for Singleplayer and Multiplayer.

## BACKGROUND FEATURES _with no ON/OFF Toggle_


### Always working in any Gamemode

Class can always be changed.

Carepackage stall is always possible with any carepackage (yours, teammate and enemy).

Tactical insertion cannot be destroyed by other players.

Tactical insertion can be used in FFA.

No second chance perk. If someone is detected with second chance the perk is automatically removed from him.

Everyone gets Marathon Pro, Steady Aim Pro and Hardened Pro. In S&D all players also get Lightweight Pro.

All snipers do unlimited damage only in S&D and FFA, in all other gamemodes I bumped up the damage by 8 to reduce the hitmarkers, the damage of other weapons is reduced by 5 but it doesn't noticibly change anything.

When the Timer is at 1 second, 2 minutes are automatically added. Only works one time per round.
