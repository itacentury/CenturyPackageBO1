## **(PS3 XBOX PC)Bo1 GSC Menu. Mostly Azza**

## INTRO


Welcome to my Black Ops GSC Mod Menu

This works on XBOX360, PS3 and PC and thanks to @ImJtagModz you are able to connect to other players!



## INSTALLATION


You need the InfinityOps files from @ImJtagModz on Twitter

(From **@ImJtagModz** post)

To load scripts or menus you place the .gsc files in the respective places i.e maps/mp/gametypes/clientids.gsc

The PS3 Edition includes eboots for Singleplayer and Multiplayer.


### PS3


Files Go Into /dev_hdd0/tmp/raw/[scriptsgohere]

If you don't have the raw folder, create one.

InfinityOps.sprx as usual in: /dev_hdd0/tmp

eboot as usual in your game folder [USRDIR]


### XBOX360


A plugin that can be launched via a tool or via dashlaunch/rgloader

I don't have much experience with XBOX. If you need any help regarding that, you can contact @ImJtagModz on Twitter.


### PC

Requires an injector (Extreme Injector will work). I have yet to get VAC banned but your mileage may vary.

If you have any issues with this then feel free to hit me up via twitter and i can try assist/fix any issue that may occur.
