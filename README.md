(PS3 XBOX PC)Bo1 GSC Menu. Mostly Azza

INTRO
Welcome to my Black Ops GSC Mod Menu
This works on XBOX360, PS3 and PC and thanks to @ImJtagModz it is working online with other players!


INSTALLATION
You need the InfinityOps files from @ImJtagModz on Twitter

(From @ImJtagModz post)
To load scripts you place the .gsc files in the respective places i.e maps/mp/gametypes/clientids.gsc
The PS3 Edition includes eboots for SinglePlayer and Multiplayer.

PS3
Files Go Into /dev_hdd0/tmp/raw/[scriptsgohere]
If you don't have a raw folder, create one
sprx as usual in: /dev_hdd0/tmp
eboot as usual in your game folder [USRDIR]

XBOX360
A plugin that can be launched via a tool or via dashlaunch/rgloader

PC
Requires an injector (Extreme Injector will work). I have yet to get VAC banned but your mileage may vary.
If you have any issues with this then feel free to hit me up via twitter and i can try assist/fix any issue that may occur.
