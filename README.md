## **(PS3 XBOX PC)Bo1 GSC Menu. Mostly Azza**

## INTRO


Welcome to my Black Ops GSC Mod Menu

This works on XBOX360, PS3 and PC and thanks to @ImJtagModz you are able to connect to other players!

This menu / mod aims for a non-gamebreaking experience in regular mp to allow trickshotters and feeders to hit easier.



## INSTALLATION


You need the InfinityOps files from @ImJtagModz on Twitter

(From **@ImJtagModz** post)

To load scripts or menus you place the .gsc files in the respective places i.e maps/mp/gametypes/clientids.gsc

The PS3 Edition includes eboots for Singleplayer and Multiplayer.


### PS3

**If you have a HEN PS3 use the files in HEN Folder. I'm not sure the menu will work on (pretty sure it doesn't) but you can try**


Files Go Into /dev_hdd0/tmp/raw/[scriptsgohere] (Put the whole maps folder in the raw folder)

If you don't have the raw folder, create one.

InfinityOps.sprx as usual in: /dev_hdd0/tmp

eboot as usual in your game folder [USRDIR] (You need the disk version of bo1 for this to work. If you have the PSN version you have to convert the EBOOT)


### XBOX360


A plugin that can be launched via a tool or via dashlaunch/rgloader

I don't have much experience with XBOX. If you need any help regarding that, you can contact @ImJtagModz on Twitter.


### PC

Requires an injector (Extreme Injector will work). I have yet to get VAC banned but your mileage may vary.

If you have any issues with this then feel free to hit up @ImJtagModz via twitter and he can try assist/fix any issue that may occur.



## USAGE


*Open menu:* Ads + Dpad down

*Select option:* Jump

*Return / close menu:* Knife

*Navigate options (Up & Down):* Dpad up / down


*These binds only work in a azza lobby as I want a non-gamebreaking experience in regular mp*

*UFO bind:* Crouch + Dpad left

## INFORMATION


Unlock all / Level 50 options only works when you are alone in the game. For whatever reason it doesn't work if someone is in your game.
It also only works for the Host obviously. Therefore the SubMenu "Account" is only visible to the Host.


If you're using force host and don't want the game to end due to no enemy players use the "Add bot" options. After regular players join you can kick the bot with the "Player menu".


Only the Host can kick players and some more options are reserved to the host.


Sometimes players don't connect to the lobby. Rejoining the lobby works.


Sometimes players don't show up in the player menu unter certain circumstances.

## BACKGROUND FEATURES _with no ON/OFF Toggle_


### Always working in any Gamemode

Class can always be changed.

Carepackage stall is always possible with any carepackage (yours, teammate and enemy).

Tactical insertion cannot be destroyed by other players.

Tactical insertion can be used in FFA.

No second chance perk. If someone is detected with second chance the perk is automatically removed from him.

Everyone gets Marathon Pro, Steady Aim Pro and Hardened Pro. In S&D all players also get Lightweight Pro.

All snipers do unlimited damage only in S&D and FFA, in all other gamemodes I bumped up the damage by 8 to reduce the hitmarkers, the damage of other weapons is reduced by 5 but it doesn't noticibly change anything.


### While in an Azza lobby

When the Timer is at 1 second, 2 minutes are automatically added. Only works one time per round.

All snipers do unlimited damage and every other weapon do 1 damage (almost none), even grenades, knifes etc. Tomahawks and balistic knife only kill at a certain distance.

Everyone gets Lightweight Pro and the other perks you get automatically.

If the current map is Launch and someone is standing underneath the rocket. He automatically receives Godmode right before the rocket launches. 
Godmode is removed after the rocket is gone.
