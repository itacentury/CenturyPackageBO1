## Introduction
This works on `XBOX360`, `PS3` and `PC` and thanks to `@ImJtagModz` you are able to connect to other players!

This menu / mod aims to provide a non-gamebreaking experience in regular multiplayer to allow trickshotters and snipers to have an easier and fun time. It also includes general quality of life updates!

You need the InfinityOps files from `@ImJtagModz` on Twitter. To load scripts or menus you place the `.gsc` files in the respective places. A force host eboot for PS3 is also included.

1. Put the `raw` folder that comes in the downloaded zip into `/dev_hdd0/tmp/`
